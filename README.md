This assignment contains three components to help enhancing understanding and practical application in natural language processing and machine learning.

Components:

Gradient Descent Exercise: This component provides a detailed walkthrough of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), a widely used optimization algorithm in machine learning. It includes documentation of each step: input calculation, prediction, loss assessment, weight adjustments, and updates.

Attention Mechanism Exercise: The exercise involves implementing attention mechanisms on two sentences containing polysomous words, facilitating hands-on experience in attention mechanism implementation and understanding.

Gradio Job Search App: a Gradio-based job search application. Users can explore relevant job postings by inputting queries, in this case highest level of finished education. Leveraging a pre-trained Sentence Transformer model, the app performs semantic search to return job postings based on semantic similarity.
